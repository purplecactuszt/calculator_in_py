I am a 13yr old and I'm interested in software engineering. I learned basicly half of the c# but I have dropped it for I don't even know what reason.
I have started learning python a few days ago and have some experience from my school in which during IT we have programmed a few things. When I think about it we have not really
programmed anything but we just copied code from our textbooks. But I still learned something! So yeah. Now you know something about me! I'm currently a self taught programme but when I get a chance to chose a highschool I will study probably math cause I like math. I will 100% go to computer scinece college in the future.
